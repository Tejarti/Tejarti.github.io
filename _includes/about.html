  Just a small token of love for the most beautiful girl I've ever met.<br>
  Thanks for coming to my life and making it extra special. I never thought that I can fall in love with someone but you just swept me off my feet and made my world a better place. <br>
  I used to listen to a lot of love songs and read a lot of shayaris but now I truly realize the meaning of it.<br>
  Thanks for making me a better person with evey passing day.<br>
  I might not be able to promise you that we won't have up and downs but I do promise that I'll always be there with you through those up and downs,
 So I just want to wish us a very happy married life that we are going to have soon
<br> P.S. - sorry for the simplicty of this page. I was only able to learn this much in last few days XD</p>
